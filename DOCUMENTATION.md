## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the YouTube Timestamp Bookmarker! This Chrome extension enhances your YouTube experience by allowing you to:

   - Handles user interactions

2. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Injected into YouTube pages
   - Captures video information and timestamps
   - Handles keyboard shortcuts

3. **Background Script** (`background.js`)
   - Manages data storage
   - Handles communication between components
   - Maintains extension state

4. **Storage** (Chrome Storage API)
   - Persists bookmarks between sessions
   - Stores all bookmark data locally

## üíæ Data Storage

Bookmarks are stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API with the following schema:

```javascript
{
  "bookmarks": [
    {
      "videoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",      // YouTube video ID
      "title": "Video Title",        // Video title at time of bookmark
      "time": 123.45,               // Timestamp in seconds
      "note": "Important moment",   // User's note (optional)
      "timestamp": "2025-06-29T06:30:00.000Z"  // When bookmark was created
    }
  ]
}
```

## üôè Acknowledgments

- Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for the YouTube community
- Inspired by the need for better video note-taking tools
- Made possible by the Chrome Extension platform
- Gets the current video time and title
- Handles jumping to specific timestamps when you click a bookmark
- Shows a small indicator when the extension is active

### 5. `background.js` - The Backend

This script runs in the background and handles:
- Storing and retrieving bookmarks using Chrome's storage API
- Showing notifications when bookmarks are added
- Injecting the content script when needed
- Managing communication between different parts of the extension

### 6. `styles.css` - Making It Pretty

This file contains all the styling for the popup, including:
- Layout and spacing
- Colors and typography
- Hover and active states for buttons
- Scrollable bookmarks list

## üîÑ How It All Works Together

1. **Adding a Bookmark**:
   - You press Ctrl/Cmd + B while watching a video
   - `content.js` captures this and gets the current time and video info
   - It sends this data to `background.js`
   - `background.js` saves it to Chrome's storage
   - The popup updates to show the new bookmark

2. **Viewing Bookmarks**:
   - When you click the extension icon, `popup.html` loads
   - `popup.js` fetches all saved bookmarks from storage
   - It displays them in a nice, scrollable list

3. **Jumping to a Timestamp**:
   - You click on a bookmark in the popup
   - `popup.js` tells `content.js` to jump to that timestamp
   - `content.js` finds the video and sets the current time

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts and APIs Used

1. **Chrome Extension APIs**:
   - `chrome.storage` - For saving and loading data
   - `chrome.tabs` - For interacting with browser tabs
   - `chrome.runtime` - For communication between scripts
   - `chrome.scripting` - For injecting scripts

2. **JavaScript Concepts**:
   - Event listeners and handlers
   - Promises and async/await
   - DOM manipulation
   - Local storage

3. **Web Technologies**:
   - HTML5 Video API
   - CSS Flexbox for layout
   - ES6+ JavaScript features
